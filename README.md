# Crusty Malware Samples
------------------------
Welcome to Crusty Malware! This repository is composed of experimental Rust-based malware samples for
use in educational lab environments. Produced by cyber students from the University of Arizona, these are 
intended for exploratory malware engineering and reverse engineering, as well as greater exposure to
the Rust language and it's many features. 

If you'd like to contribute either to the code or brainstorming on its possible applications or direction, 
please reach out to any of the users currently joined to this repo (school life is heavy atm, please be 
patient).
